GND goes to the minus. After plugging in the other cable with a pin, the number of said pin is what you need to use in the code. If something doesn't work try a different pin that has or hasn't the "~" sign.

----------
CODE

const int <pin> = <analogPinNumber>;
// do it for every pin you use
int state = 0; //used for saving button result

void setup() { // runs only ONCE
	Serial.begin(9600); //idk what this does but we follow thr tutorial. if something doesn't work maybe just comment this out.
	pinMode.(<pinNumber>, OUTPUT/INPUT); // defines the pin. type either OUTPUT or INPUT, not the two at once.
}

void loop() {
	digitalWrite(<pinNumber>, HIGH/LOW); // if HIGH then led will light up if LOW it will not.
	delay(<time>); // delays execution
	state = digitalRead(<pinNumber>); // if button is pressed state will be true or HIGH and if not it'll be low.
	if (state == HIGH){
		digitalWrite(<pinNumber>, LOW);
	}
}
