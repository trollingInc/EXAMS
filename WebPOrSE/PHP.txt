if php is required and we are unlucky, this is how to connect to mysql database:

$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$dbname = "<databaseName>";
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname)
//check if successful
if(conn->connect_error){
	die("Connection failed");
}

//extracting from the html form
if(isset($_POST['lsubmit-btn'])){
	$usname = $_POST['<name/id of form field>']; //in my template this would be "lusername" for the login
	$pass = $_POST['lpassword'];

	//inserting into the database (signup)
	$sql = "INSERT INTO <table>(<column1>, <column2>...) VALUES('$usname', '$pass'...)";
	//check if query succeeded not sure if this is how you do it but you can try if you want to
	if ($conn->query($sql) === TRUE){
		echo "Success";
	}
	else{
		echo "Failed";
	}

	//checking from the database (login)
	$sql = "SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE <column> = '$usname' AND <column> = '$pass'";
	$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
	$row = mysqli_fetch_array($result, MYSQLI_ASSOC); //not sure what this is for and whether it's needed or not
	$count = mysqli_num_rows($result);
	if($count == 1){ //login is valid
		//do something when logged in successfully
	}
	else{ //login is invalid
		echo "Invalid username or password";
	}
}
